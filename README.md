Company Sales Data Visualization

This project uses a Jupyter Notebook to perform an exploratory data analysis on a provided sales dataset. The goal is to visualize key performance metrics using Python's data science libraries.

Visualizations Created:
1. Total Monthly Profit: A line plot illustrating the company's total profit for each month over a year.
2.  Product Sales Comparison: A multi-plot figure showing the month-by-month sales data for "Bathing Soap" and "Facewash" in separate subplots for clear comparison.

### Technologies Used:
Python 3
Jupyter Notebook for interactive analysis.
Pandas for data loading and manipulation from a CSV file.
Matplotlib for creating static, high-quality plots and charts.
